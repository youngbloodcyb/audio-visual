# audio-visual

This is a project visualizing audio with three.js and the browser audio API

The next step will be to add audio from SoundCloud's API and stream the audio to the HTML audio element.

This project is inspired by https://github.com/SuboptimalEng/gamedex/tree/main/audio-visualizer. I took lots of his code for the vertex and fragment shaders and made minor changes. Instead of building the project in React, I opted to use Vanilla JS for simplicity and use Vite for build and tooling.
